    <p>Berries are sweet, but also contain a boost of disease-fighting antioxidants, fiber and vitamins.
         It's fun to hear my kids ask for seconds, 
        especially when I know the smoothies we make are also loaded with spinach, kale, 
        or chia or flax seeds to add fiber, protein and healthy omega fats.
         I make it a goal to get at least three servings of fruits and vegetables in each smoothie I make.</p>

    <p>Fresh fruit boasts a high amount of fiber, water, and a slew of other vitamins and minerals--but it can also come with a good amount of sugar.
         Even though fruit contains only natural sugars and is a healthy choice in moderation, it's a good idea to watch how much sugar you're taking in 
         regardless of where it comes from. Have you ever wondered just how much of the sweet stuff is found in nature's candy? If you were to
         choose the fruit with the least amount of naturally-occurring sugar, which would be your best bet: Bananas, apples, or oranges?</p>

    <p>A new study found that stone fruits known as drupes contain compounds that could reduce serious health risks from obesity and inflammation found
         with metabolic syndrome. Since insulin resistance or diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol abnormalities and abdominal obesity affect millions of
          people every year, this could be a very important finding. Although lifestyle, genetic predisposition, and diet play an influential role, research
           findings suggesting diet can be turned into an 
        asset instead of liability provides some hope for those seeking to change their medical condition outcomes.</p>

            <p>The vegan food plate provides a simple guide to making healthy food choices, and corresponds to current scientific knowledge regarding 
                the health effects of what we eat and drink. Endorsed by various nutrition societies and national governments, it is a more up-to-date

        <p>hinking of ditching animal products in your diet? Your body may thank you. A study published in April 2019 in the Journal of Nutrition found 
            that following a plant-based diet may offer a slew of health benefits, such as lowering markers for diseases, including certain types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. In the study, vegans not only had a lower body mass index (BMI) than non 
            vegetarians (24.7 on average, versus 29.2), they also had lower proportions of saturated fatty acids.</p>

             Brownie, from breakfast and snacks to burgers to desserts. But Browne is more than just a vegan food blog; it’s an online program for people interested 
             in becoming vegan, or making more vegan choices. The Road map course ($97), for example, covers vegan nutrition basics, shopping for 
            and planning vegan meals, navigating social situations, and — of course — whipping up tasty vegan recipes.</p>

            <p>It’s a wildly popular rumor that frozen veggies and fruits aren’t as nutritious as their frozen counterparts. This simply isn’t true. Studies by the FDA 
                have confirmed that any decrease in nutrition from freezing vegetables is negligible at best. So you can eat it fresh, frozen, or even drink it and you’ll 
                get the same benefits! Do keep in mind
                 that if you drink it, it has to be 100% juice. A brand with only 10% is obviously not going to be more nutritious.</p>

            <p>One of the most enjoyable parts of United States culture are the faces of awe you get when you tell someone that tomatoes are actually fruit because they have seeds. 
                It is technically true and a lot of people don’t know that they have a fruit in their salad.
                 However, in the late 1800’s, the US Supreme Court ruled that tomatoes are to be considered a vegetable.</p>
